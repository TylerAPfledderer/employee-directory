## Primary Takeaways of this build

This is a project primarily focused on Vanilla JavaScript to render a random list of employees and information from the Random User API. Clicking on an employee brings up a modal with additional information, and the modal can be paginated between the employees. Further, which employees the modal paginates through is based on the search filter by name, should the user try to narrow down the list.
